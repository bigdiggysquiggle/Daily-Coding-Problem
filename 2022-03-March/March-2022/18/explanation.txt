so climb accepts the number of steps in your staircase and a
set of possible amounts you can step at a time as argument.
it defaults to being able to step up 1 or 2 steps at a time
cuz of the problem description. so yeah, if there's no
stairs left to climb, you've reached the top and you're done
so you count that as 1 unique way to get up the steps. 

if you're not at the top, then the for loop takes each value
that's in that array of how many steps you're allowed to
take at a time and runs the function again but after having
climbed the allowed amounts ;3 so like, if your set of
allowed steps is 1, 2, 3 then it starts an instance where
it's climbed up 1 step, another where it's climbed up 2
steps, and one more where it's climbed up 3 steps 

since that recurses, it ends up exploring every possible
combination of the allowed amounts of steps and only ones
that successfully make it to the top (where stair is 0 so it
returns 1) get counted

it doesn't even finish calculating for ones that don't make
it to the top, those will have a 0 total so they'll just
return 0. otherwise it'll end up going back and giving
another 1 for each way that made it to the top and each of
those 1s get added together, giving us the final count
