I signed up over on https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/ to have
a real coding problem asked during real coding interviews sent
to my email every morning. This will serve as my workspace and
home for the solutions I come up with.

I will be completing each of these in one of C/C++, Python, or
Java to both keep my skills sharp with each language and build
my knowledge and understanding of common algorithms referrenced
in an interview setting

As each challenge is given daily, the number of each directory
is the day that I was given the challenge, not the number ofs
the challenge itself
