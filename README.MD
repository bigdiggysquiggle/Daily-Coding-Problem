I signed up over on https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/ to have
a real coding problem asked during real coding interviews sent
to my email every morning. This will serve as my workspace and
home for the solutions I come up with. The majority of these
are going to be completed in Python, as my goal is to get used
to answering these kinds of questions in an interview setting
and I feel that Python is the best for quick-drafting
algorithms and ideas in that kind of setting. As I come up with
better solutions or otherwise feel the need to revisit old
problems, I will be adding new notes and solutions

UPDATE: I have switched to completing these challenges in Java
so I can better solidify the fundamental concepts of programming
in Java for my current job
