For this challenge, I chose a simple mathematical approach. I
tested whether the number at the current index could be added
with any number after it in the array to achieve the desired
solution. There is no need to test later numbers against
previous numbers, as when the previous number was tested, it
would have been added with the current number. My solution
doesn't require multiple passes that start from the beginning
of the input array. At this time I am unsure whether there is
a more efficient method or not.
